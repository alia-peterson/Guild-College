# Guild University Code Sample

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Goals and Instructions

The goal for this project was create an application in approximately 1-hour that would allow a student at a community college to:
- View available courses
- Register for courses
- View their course registrations
- Cancel registrations

## Running the web application

Clone this repository to your local machine

`cd Guild-College`

In this project directory, run:

`npm install` 
`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in the browser.

## Testing

No tests were created for this application as there was little functionality that could be tested using unit testing, and because the application is simple enough that end-to-end testing seemed lower priority. If I were to build tests for this application, I would likely use Cypress, as this is the technology that I am most familiar with from class.

## Technologies

This application was built using React.js, HTML, and CSS
